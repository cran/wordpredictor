Description: A framework for developing n-gram models for text prediction.
    It provides data cleaning, data sampling, extracting tokens from text,
    model generation, model evaluation and word prediction. For information on how n-gram models 
    work we referred to: "Speech and Language Processing"
    <https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf>. For optimizing R code and
    using R6 classes we referred to "Advanced R" 
    <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html>. For writing R extensions we referred to 
    "R Packages", <https://r-pkgs.org/index.html>.
